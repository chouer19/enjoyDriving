# Self-Driving C++ Project 

### 


## Usage

### Prerequisites

You will need:

 * A modern C/C++ compiler
 * CMake 3.1+ installed (on a Mac, run `brew install cmake`)
 * If you prefer to code in a great IDE, I highly recommend [Jetbrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). It is fully compatible with this project.

### Building The Project

## File Locations

 * `src/*` — C++ code
 * `lib` — C++ libraries
 * `include` — C++ headers
 * `bin`, is an empty directory, until build the project.


#### Contributing
